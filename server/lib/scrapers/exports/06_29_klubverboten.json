The only occasion to have your bare bottom tickled by sun, paddles, and beyond is this summer in this super secluded location in Hackney.

Only approved members can bypass our door vetting teams. Non-members will need to get vetted at each new event again and thus queue for longer.\n.\n/// DRESS CODE\nKlub Verboten is a fetish club with a strict dress code policy. If you are inexperienced, stick to these: Latex, Rubber, PVC, Leather, Metal or Lace. Your outfit does not need to be expensive; creativity & authentic expression are essential. That rigorously thought-through piece of rubber may be the enabler to a dialogue leading to a later radical and hard-loving friendship. If your outfit is not Klub Verboten enough, we cannot let you enter. If one could wear it in a cocktail bar, you can't wear it at a fet1sh club. Safeguarding our cumunity is paramount; therefore, we may refuse entry to anyone whose outfit communicates a lack of understanding required to navigate these spaces. We cannot give feedback on individual outfits before the event. Yes, you can get changed at the venue, and there is a cloakroom.

The only occasion to have your bare bottom tickled by sun, paddles, and beyond is this summer in this super secluded location in Hackney. After last year's avalanche of bruised skin, double-enders, and latex dancing, we decided to run a Summer F1st series to give a home to those stranded non-package holiday gimpsters in need.\n.\n/// ABOUT KLUB VERBOTEN\nKlub Verboten launched in 2016 and is a provider of contemporary pro-pervert spaces. A community bound by modern human interaction. A grassroots movement matured into tens of thousands of caring Kinksters. Dedicated to the spatial, sonic and visual understanding of future BDSM / fetish practises and culture, we set the gold standard in safeguarding. Stagnant-prescribed erotic orthodoxies are no longer. Ditch your sex-corp. dating app. Leave the nuclear warfare GHB at home. Play is okay.\n.\n/// STAY CONNECTED VIA TELEGRAM\n<a href=\"https://t.me/+ieAi8bXTUuE4MjZk\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/+ieAi8bXTUuE4MjZk</a>\n.\n/// DISCOUNTED MEMBERS TICKETS\nKlub Verboten Members can unhide discounted early bird tickets using their Membership Number (code) whilst allocations last. Once they are gone, they are gone, the code will expire for this event. Members tickets are for members only - they cannot be purchased or transferred to non-members. Members & non-members can purchase General Admission tickets.\n.\n/// KLUB RULES\nImportant. If you have not fully processed + understood our Klub Rules, we cannot let you enter. We expect you to explain our Klub Rules at any given point.\n--&gt; <a href=\"https://klubverboten.com/rules\" target=\"_blank\">https://klubverboten.com/rules</a>\n.\n/// BECOME A MEMBER\nOur spaces are laboratories for modern kink culture. Thus, safeguarding is at the core of everything we do to enable freedoms and complexities of play that sadly do not often find understanding in the world outside these walls. Klub Verboten Members are the most caring and perverted people around; in return, members benefit from the following goodies:\n.\n+ FAST TRACK QUEUE\n+ NO DOOR VETTING\n+ MEMBERS ONLY PLAY SPACE (LDN)\n+ ADMISSION TO MEMBERS + FRIENDS EVENTS\n+ % EARLY BIRD TICKETS (BER + LDN)\n+ % TICKETS FOR TEARS FOR BEERS\n+ ACCESS TO THE NUDES GALLERY\n.\n/// HOW TO GET INTO KLUB VERBOTEN\nEveryone is subject to a vetting procedure at some stage to ensure relative safety + ultraperverions. There are three routes to attend our main event in London + Berlin:\n.\nI. [BECOME A MEMBER ONLINE]\nII. [GET VETTED IN PERSON AT TEARS FOR BEERS]\nIII. [BUY A TICKET + GET VETTED EACH TIME YOU ENTER THE MAIN EVENT*]\n.\n*Non-members can purchase tickets and come to our doors. But are subject to door vetting: We may have to refuse your entry + refund your ticket if we do not feel comfortable yet letting you enter such a fragile dollop of human complexities. Only approved members can bypass our door vetting teams. Non-members will need to get vetted at each new event again and thus queue for longer.\n.\n/// DRESS CODE\nKlub Verboten is a fetish club with a strict dress code policy. If you are inexperienced, stick to these: Latex, Rubber, PVC, Leather, Metal or Lace. Your outfit does not need to be expensive; creativity & authentic expression are essential. That rigorously thought-through piece of rubber may be the enabler to a dialogue leading to a later radical and hard-loving friendship. If your outfit is not Klub Verboten enough, we cannot let you enter. If one could wear it in a cocktail bar, you can't wear it at a fet1sh club. Safeguarding our cumunity is paramount; therefore, we may refuse entry to anyone whose outfit communicates a lack of understanding required to navigate these spaces. We cannot give feedback on individual outfits before the event. Yes, you can get changed at the venue, and there is a cloakroom.
